As someone who used to work in a web development environment but chose to make a career switch and develop other skills, I
believe that at one point in the future I would find myself in the position of hiring programmers. Therefore, my key takeaway
from the class is about best practices in hiring someone for a programming position given my limited and outdated technical
knowledge. I have learned what are some of the key parameters to look at when considering a candidate. The class discussion
helped me construct a short but very robust set of questions for the “technical” part of the interview:

•	What framework the programmer is using

•	What kind of unit-testing method they use

•	What tools they use for version control

•	What is the programmer’s GitHub account

Each of the questions could help me eliminate a candidate in case the answer indicates they do not use one of the tools asked
about. Not using one or more of these tools simply indicate that I can expect the programmer to either invest too much time
writing code that is already available (and probably much better than one would write), overlook malfunctions in their software
due to lack of structured testing, or override work given the lack of an organized repository system to assist with version
control. 

In addition, based on the professors comment in class, I believe that I am better equipped to recognize a good candidates based
on the structure of their answers. A good answer would be constructed with the programmer’s choice, the alternatives they have
considered, and a reason for the choice.
