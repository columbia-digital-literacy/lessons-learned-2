# Becoming more productive when using a computer

Lessons which stuck to me most during “Digital Literacy” course were about productivity when using a computer. Whether one is a developer, designer, product manager or a consultant – we all use computers as our primary tool. I myself use a computer for approximately 12 hours per day when at work. Thus, being more efficient and productive, even just by saving a few seconds several times per day, can help reduce my overall work time.

Some specific tips I’ve learned during the course – 

- Avoid using a mouse – take time to learn keyboard shortcuts. Whether it’s general windows/mac shortcuts or for specific software, every action which can be done using a keyboard only will save valuable seconds

- Learn touch typing – spend more time thinking on important tasks, rather than looking at keyboard

- Use scripts – for really common actions and tasks use scripts (or productivity software like Alfred for Mac). I’ve downloaded Alfred after the third class, and it seems as if it will change my computer habits for good. For PC, one can easily write batch scripts. Microsoft even offers a tutorial for that, see [Microsoft batch tutorial](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176792.aspx "https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176792.aspx")

- Read recommended business/technology literacy (e.g., The Pragmatic Programmer). Improves not only technical, but also management and productivity skills

Finally, I’ve learned not to treat technical problems as some mysterious “cloud” which takes a technical person to solve, but be more independent and explore solutions myself. Most things can be easily Googled and learned.
