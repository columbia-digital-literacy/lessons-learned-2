Impact of technology choices

One of key take-away I got from this class, is how many technology choices there will be for any project, and
how much impact these choices would have down the line.

To start a simple consumer facing mobile application, even after reaching agreement on all the features of the
first version, we would still have a long list of decisions to make, including where to host our static assets,
which database to store data with, which language to implement the backend with, where to host the whole
backend service, when to starting moving towards SOA architecture, which mobile frontend technology to choice,
what third party to choice for payment, mapping , customer support , and the list goes on.

All the choices we make in the beginning would directly impact how soon the first version of the product could
be built, how much money it would cost, how easy it is to maintain this project, how scalable and reliable the
service would be, and what kind of engineers to hire in the future , and would shape the team or company from
many aspects.
