The answer to if we / a company should build a new piece of software is usually NO in most cases (or not yet).  Before deciding to raise funds and hiring a development team, we need to make sure there is a real need for the thing we are about to build.  The following is an outline of a process that should be followed before ever beginning to write a line of code:

1.  Problem:  Is there a real addressable problem and market?  Would anyone care about this?  What are we really trying to solve?  We should conduct research through surveys and ask the right questions to potential users.  
2.  Solution / Initial Design:   How would we do this?  Begin to craft a plan for what it might look like.   
3.  Prototype / Experiment:  The most simple model or release of a product built to test the concept or process.  Should just be our minimum viable product (MVP) that allows the product to be deployed.  Test on early adopters.

These steps will help achieve goal of building the right piece of software, not just software right. We want to maximize the rate at which we learn about the product.  We want to reduce wasted engineering hour and get the product to early customers as soon as possible!
