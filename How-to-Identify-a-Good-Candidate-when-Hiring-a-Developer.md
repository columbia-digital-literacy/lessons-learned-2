#*Identifying a Good Developer*
As someone who does not know how to code very well, it is important to master interview tactics that will allow me to identify a programmer we would want to hire for my company.
The most important takeaway from Digital Literacy class is that this can easily be accomplished by focusing on some *KEY* questions.

1. What version control tool do you use? Why do you use that over others?
2. Do you use frameworks? [Note: THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY USE FRAMEWORKS) Why do you use [framework of choice] over the others available?
3. Do you have a GitHub acocunt? It is important that developers have used GitHub and have collaborated

In all cases, the candidate should be using some sort of version control tool/frameworks, etc. And they should have a structured reason why they are using that over another.

If all of this fails, just pick up programming yourself by [starting with this book](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/computers-software/programming.html)
