Especially for people who don’t have a computer science background it will be important to be able to communicate effectively with the programmers we may have to work with. 
In this context sticky notes (even if they may seem old fashioned) provide an advance both in terms of clarity and process.
Clarity:
-	You can create a simple user story for the “issue” you want to address, having on the sticky note only: 
o	As a [ROLE]
o	I want [FEATURE]
o	So that [BENEFIT]
-	By doing so you can create ‘simple’ workstreams that can be more easily address and discussed by the programmers in the team
Process:
-	Using sticky notes is a great visual way to keep track of process, and the concrete action of moving some task across the production line also has a positive psychological effect on whoever just accomplished the task.
-	Additionally if we decide to use different processes like Scrum or Kanban, using sticky notes makes it very easy to visualize how we plan to proceed.
