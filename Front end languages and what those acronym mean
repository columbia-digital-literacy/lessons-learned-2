Front end applications and its acronyms:
Front end is a term used to characterize program interfaces and services relative to some sort of program.  
Front end development combines programming skills and aesthetics.  
There are several tools available that can be used to develop the front end of a website, including HTML, CSS, CMS, AJAX and JS.  
A front-end application is one that application users interact with directly.
A back-end application or program serves indirectly in support of the front-end services, usually by being closer to the required
resource or having the capability to communicate with the required resource.  There is no incompatibility issue between front end and back end.
Oftentimes these front end applications are known by their acronyms.  Below are the aforementioned acronyms and their meanings:
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language:   HTML code provides an overall framework of how a website will look.  
It describes the text on the page.  HTML 5 is the latest version of HTML
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets:  Controls the presentation aspect of the site and enables site to have its own unique look
JS - JavaScript: Typically used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side 
scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.
It allows animation, user input, and validation.
HTML, CSS, and JS are the very well known.  The diagram below provides a simple illustration of their connection:

AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: A method of building interactive applications for the Web that process user requests immediately 
is not a technolgy by itself but a group of technologies, including JS and CSS. One of the best example of AJAX product is Google Mail
