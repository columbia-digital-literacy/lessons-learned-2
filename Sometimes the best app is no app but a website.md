A key take-away for me from Digital Literacy class was when to use a website vs an app, and when to use PhoneGap or Titanium vs a natively built app.


A **website** is the best solution to ensure
* Time-to-market
* Reach
* Simplicity
* Skills


Having a responsive (mobile first) website also has the advantage of being well visible on a mobile device of any operating system without having to download an additional app. *Twitter Bootstrap* and *Zurb Foundation* are free tools that can be helpful for creating responsive websites.


On the other hand, the advantages of an **app** are

• Owning the app ‘real estate’ space

• Allowing the user to do more (e.g. interact with GPS, camera, accelerometer)

• Higher performance

• Offline usability

• In-store promotions/geo-tagging

• Notifications

• Buzz

• Creating a habit

• Potential personalization

• Can be free or paid, or provide in-app paid services


When an app is needed, *PhoneGap* can provide a quick and affordable prototype that works on all devices, while *Titanium* is a more aesthetic solution but not available for all operating systems. A *native app* is the most expensive solution and has to be developed for each operating system individually. If this is the best solution in the long run, it might pay off to invest in an app early.


An app is generally the more expensive and complex way to go. Users generally have their limited number of apps that they use on a regular basis. Often these apps have strong network effects (e.g. Facebook, Whatsapp) or require strong performance (e.g. games) or should have offline functionality as well (e.g. books, songs). A website with a login section can provide a great user experience across operating systems and devices at lower cost and should be the place to start for most to test the concept and build a regular user base.
