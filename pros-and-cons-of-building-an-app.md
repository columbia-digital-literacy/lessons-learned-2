Currently, many companies want to build an app for their customers.  However, as we learned in class, there are many pros and cons that need to be considered before developing an app.  Sometimes an app is not necessary, for example if your website displays well across multiple smart phone browser platforms.  A good app solves a problem or fulfills a specific need.  

Pros:
Tends to load quicker than websites on smart phone browsers
Provides opportunity for user customization and regular usage
Apps have better accessibility to native functionality like the phoneâ€™s camera or contacts
Internet connection is not required depending on the apps function
Users tend to spend more time on apps than on websites. Apps also tend to have higher engagement with users than mobile websites  
Can target different user segments ie customer, vendor, owner

Cons:
Needs to be programmed in order to be available across a variety of browsers and devices
More costly than optimizing a website for mobile browsers. Also the more functionality an app has the higher the cost
Requires constant upkeep because of content and technology changes. A mobile website is more dynamic and flexible to update than an app
Average life of an app is shorter than a mobile website
Harder to locate than mobile websites
Less reach than mobile websites

Apps and mobile websites are both good ways to create a mobile presence.  However, it is important to ascertain your organizations mobile needs before investing in an app.
