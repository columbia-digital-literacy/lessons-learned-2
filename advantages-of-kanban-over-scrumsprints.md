Scrum sprints are good for larger scale, structured devlopment. Once you define the user stories and decide what you want to tackle for the sprint, you can keep your team focused and check in with them at scheduled times to follow their process. It also fundamentally protects your developers from the "good idea fairy." They are given goals and a timeframe and set loose. 
But Scrum is also fundamentally inflexible. Once a sprint starts, you are locked in and can't change anything without bringing the whole process to a screeching halt and it may take a few days to stop, review and restart another sprint. That is a big waste of time. Another waste of productivity can occur when people complete things early in a sprint while other work is left to be done but can't be completed by the developer who finished. Or more basically, developers have few incentives to finish before the end of the sprint even if it is achievable.

Although there is no sprint structure with fundamental rules protecting developers from being inundated with changes, a good PM/head engineer will make sure to shield the team from too many unnecessary changes to the stories that have completed/are working on. But adaptability of Kanban is another big advantage over Scrum. User stories can change in the queue even while developers are working on something else with little interruption to the rest of the team. Less productivity is wasted because if the product manager is any good, there will always be stories for developers to be working on. 

Finally, Kanban allows for incremental business value by allowing developers to complete a story, deliver the small product. While a sprint is in process, there is no business value delivered until the very end when the sprint is completed.
