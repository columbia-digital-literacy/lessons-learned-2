One of the more interesting topics for me, having worked on a variety of projects that utilized many different project management techniques (whiteboarding, sticky notes, JIRA, in-house built software, etc…) was our discussion of Kanban.  Having used a Kanban method on one of my final projects while at my last company, I have seen firsthand the merits of a Kanban approach. As discussed in class, some benefits of Kanban include:
+ More flexible than Scrum. 
+ Limits work in progress, which inherently makes the process more efficient. By committing to a defined amount of WIP (should be about 2-3 tasks per developer), the team will significantly reduce context switching costs. 
+ The team does not sprint bad work. Because there are a series of checks and balances built in through QA processes, there should rarely be a situation where a task reaches the completion stage in an unworkable or less-than-ideal state. 
+ More frequent achievement – Not only does this help outsiders to understand the progress that is being made on a particular project, but it also helps to build morale within the team by allowing individuals to recognize successfully completed tasks. 
+ Consistently adds value over time (vs. Scrum which essentially saves all value added until the end)
+ Better utilization of programmers 
+ Pull-based system – Managers cannot simply push work onto engineers; Instead, engineers must ‘pull’ the work through, thereby eliminating the amount of queued up tasks sitting idle, and eliminating overwhelmed engineers who are faced with work that is pushed on to them that they are not yet ready to approach.
While I think our in-class discussion clearly highlighted the merits and downsides of both Scrum and Kanban, [this PDF] (https://www.crisp.se/file-uploads/Kanban-vs-Scrum.pdf) provides a much more comprehensive outline of both systems, for those of you who would like to explore this topic a little further. 

The biggest takeaway from this article is that the overall end goal is to ensure your organization is continuously learning. Whether you believe Scrum or Kanban is right for your team, the most important step is just getting a system in place to begin with. From there, you can always adjust your method and switch to one that works better for you.
