Its critical to identify the different user and write the user stories in the following connextra form:
As a/an _____ I want to ____ so that ____
An example:
As a bank customer
I want to withdraw money from an ATM
So that I'm not constrained by opening hours or lines at the teller's

One should also be aware of realistic and unrealistic customer requirements depending on software limitations and time constraints.
