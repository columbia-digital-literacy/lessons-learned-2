### Site vs. App
#### Key Points to consider when deciding whether to start with a site or an app
1. Time to market - sites are faster to build 
2. Skills - sites are simpler to build
3. Cost - sites are less expensive to build 
4. Reach - majority of page views of websites are already on mobile devices

Given these considerations, it usually makes sense to start with a *Responsive* website which will look good on various devices
or a *Mobile First* website that will prioritize viewing on mobile devices. 
*This is a good way to prototype and test the product quickly.

#### If a mobile app is needed after this point, there are several options.
1. **PhoneGap** is an open source tool that allows you to package your website into an app.
Although performance and look will not be as slick as a native app, it's quick and inexpensive and works on multiple platforms.

2. **Titanium Appcelerator** and similar products allow users to build *native-looking* apps that work on both iOS and Android.
Although apps will not work as well as native, they will look and feel fairly professional and have the advantage of being
built more quickly and cheaply than a native app and work across platforms.

3. **Native application** is written in the language of the phone whether iOS or Android. This route usually makes sense after
testing the prototype and learning what an optimal app needs. A native app will likely be the most costly and time-consuming, 
but it should also have the best performance and look and feel.
