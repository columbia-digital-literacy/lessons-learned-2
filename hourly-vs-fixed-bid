Programmers are typically payed in two ways: By the hour (hourly) or a fixed amount for job done (fixed bid).

Each method of payment has benefits and weaknesses.

Hourly:
  Pros:
    - Allows for greater flexibility with the project
    - Best for ongoing projects with specs that keep changing
    - Allows the client to "test out" a programmer with a small project or portion of a project
Cons:
    - Possible miss aligned interests 
    - Probably need some sort of insurance to make sure a project gets done within a certain time frame
    
Fixed Bid:
  Pros:
  - Insures the specific project gets done
  - Great for small projects or projects with a simple scope
  Cons:
  - New adjustments that fall outside of project scope become very costly
  - It's difficult for a programmer to determine how long certain projects will take
  - The project cost estimate is ussually rounded significantly up by the programmer to hedge against unforseen issues
  - Fixed bids puts a lot of pressure on initial specs, which is problematic if you're still prototyping with users
  
Conclusion:
Unless you have a small project with a very simple scope, it does not makes sense to pay via fixed bid.
Even with small projects with simple scope, it still probably makes sense to pay per hour instead.
