One of the more valuable pearls of wisdom I took away from the Digital Literacy course was to only write software if absolutely necessary.  This seems pretty counterintuitive given that everyone and their mother keeps telling me that "software is eating the world" and the epic tumblr "Whartonite Seeks Codemonkey" highlights bros just like me who are writing software.  But there are a number of considerations to keep in mind before writing software and best-practices to follow if one chooses to go down the dark path:

1. software development is slow
2. there is not enough supply of good programmers
3. software is only a fixed cost if you fale - scaling is expensive

Therefore, it is recommended that you maximize the rate at which you learn.  For starters, before writing software it is probably important to know the answers to the following questions:

1. will someone use this?
2. do I know where those people are?
3. do I know how to get their attention?
4. will the software be profitable?

To answer these questions, it is important to do surveys, perform market research, try a marketing campaign, and prototype before writing software.
