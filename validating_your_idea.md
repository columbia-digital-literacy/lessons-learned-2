It's not enough to have a _cool app idea_ -- you have to actually solve a real problem.
Research and validation is critical.
- Users: who's going to use your product, and why? what feedback have you gathered on your prototype?
- Substitutes: what do people resort to using today because your product doesnâ€™t exist yet?
- [Competition](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/26/competition-is-overrated/): who is trying to solve the same problem (who are your competitors)? who might become competitors?
- Landscape: why doesn't your product currently exist?
- Features: what's the minimum viable feature set you'll need to communicate the vision?
