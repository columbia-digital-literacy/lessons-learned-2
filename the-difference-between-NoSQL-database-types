Key/Values
  - Best example is Redis
  - In practice this looks like caching SQL data tables
  - Example use case is Amazon top seller lists. 
        - Rather than ping the SQL database 100,000 times per second
        - Maybe Amazon is ok with only updating every minute
        - Redis holds/serves the tables

Big Table 
  - Best example is Cassandra (not the one from Wayne's World)
  - Good for a ton of write tasks
    - Ingest twitter firehose
    - Record real-time trading data
    - This provides "linear write scalability"
    - The vast majority of startups or companies with "Data Science" use Cassandra underneath Hadoop
