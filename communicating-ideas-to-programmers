# Communicating Ideas to Programmers

Communication is critical in ensuring a smooth development process and building interpersonal bonding between the technical and commercial team members.

## Function instead of solution

Let your programmer know what functionality you would like to achieve instead of "instructing" him/her on what codes to write. They may be able to come up with alternatives that will require less work and more user-friendliness.

## Write things down

People forget and so do developers. Provide them with a written "script" so that they can refer back to it from time to time.
