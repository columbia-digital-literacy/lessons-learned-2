When envisioning new software, the designer will have very specific details about the softwareâ€™s functionality. This is often impractical and inefficient. Keep in mind that your code will likely be scrapped after the first few years its been implemented. The designer should first allow the developer to approach the purpose of the software. If a designer is hovering over the shoulder of a developer, the work flow and relationship can be strained.  Instead, the designer should assure that the developer understands the purpose of the software and let him/her work. This allows the designer to take the best approach towards building the software, managing any time deadlines and budget constraints. A budget will be quickly drained by obsessing over non-material details. The designer can always work in the same room to discuss and manage accordingly. Of course, if the software is designed in a time efficient manner and there is excess money in the budget, minute adjustments on the software can be tackled. 

In conclusion, micromanaging your developer is not the solution to building your software. The designer needs to develop a realistic picture of the software and adapt when the time arises. Here is the [proof](http://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-creating-micromanagement-zombies/)
