Scrum and Kanban are two software development methodologies provide rules for how work is performed
The goal of both is improved efficiency, but they have different apporaches to achieving it
|Scrum|
-------
|Scrum Description: Scrum leader prescribes rigid requirements and activities and team works within a defined period of time to complete nothing more or less than what was prescribed; there is an end-of-sprint demo event to showcase progress and receive feedback|
|Selection of Scrum Rules:| 
|(1) A product owner creates and manages a product backlog|
|(2) Teams are cross functional|
|(3) Interruptions are prohibited during sprints|
|(4) Work is time boxed|
|(5) Scrum meetings are held daily|
|(6) A burn-down chart is used to measure progress|
|Scrum Disadvantages: (1) Lots of rules to follow with little wiggle room to customize to unique business needs; (2) artificially imposed time boxes may create unnecessary interdependencies between work elements, with no buiness value being added until the end of the |
|Scrum Advantages: (1) sprint lock minimizes opportunities for distraction; (2) demo session at end of sprint provides great opportunity for stakeholder feedback and participation
-------
|Kanban|
-------
|Kanban Description: Kanban, by comparison is less restritive; the primary objective of this methodology is to limit work-in-progress work elements|
|Selection of Kanban Guidelines:|
|(1) Visualize the workflow (on a Kanban board)|
|(2) Limit work in progress work elements|
|Kanban Disadvantages: (1) work in progress limits restrict the number of elemets being progresses at a given time; (2) increased focus on quality is required, as pressure to complete elements could lead to quality issues|
|Kanban Advantages: (1) easily adapted to many environments, given few rules; (2) focus on delivering continuous business value

|Discussion: Scrum vs. Kanban|
-------
|The case for scrum: In situations where new features are being developed and significant stakeholder feedback is required, and/or if developers need to focus without being interupted, Scrum may be a better fit. The sprint lock and end-of-sprint demos to stakeholders can be invaluable.
|The case for Kanban: In more reactive development situations (for example, ongoing maintenance), Kanban may be a better fit. There is no need to lock the work element backlog and teams will have flexibility to respond to customer inputs|
