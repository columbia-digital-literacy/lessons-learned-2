When hiring a developer the questions you should ask are: 

1) what do you use for version control?

2) what is your github username?

3) how do you track bugs?

4) what tool do you use for unit testing?

For all of these questins ask what they use, what alternatives they compared their chosen tool or softwear to, and asky why they selected the actual one they  use.
