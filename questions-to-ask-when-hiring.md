When hiring a developer the questions you should ask are: 
1) what do you use for version control?
2) what is your github username?
3) how do you track bugs?
4) what tool do you use for unit testing?
- for all of these questins ask what they use, what alternatives they compared their chosen tool or softwear to, and asky why they selected the actual one they  use.
