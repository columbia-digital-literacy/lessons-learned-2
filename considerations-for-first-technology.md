# First Technology Considerations

Given their capital constraints, start ups should be mindful about the first technology / interface to develop. Before hiring any developers, a business should establish proof of concept to make sure the endeavor has a chance at profitability. 

Decision makers should then decide between developing a website for desktop/laptop usage, a mobile enhanced website or a mobile app. Given most web page visits today are done via mobile devices, it likely makes sense to begin with a mobile enhanced website which is a versatile and relatively low cost option. If the business aims to constantly be on its customers minds and gain access to contacts, calendar, etc. it may make sense to jump right in with a mobile app.

Foundation and Bootstrap are two frameworks that allow for responsive web applications.

If the venture ultimately decides it should have a mobile app in addition to its website, PhoneGap (and the underlying Cordova open source framework) provides a simple and cost effective solution. It allows you to package your front end website into a mobile app at a faster pace and lower cost than a native app. The app produced by PhoneGap won't feel native, so if intricate features and a top notch user experience are required then Titanium Appcelerator or Xamarin can create apps that feel native using Javascript or C#. After multiple iterations of the app it's likely that it will be written in the native language of the code, but for many businesses it may make sense to go through the progression mentioned above.
