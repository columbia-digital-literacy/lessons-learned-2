When typing in: 
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage") 
in your browser, your browser wants to translate this human-readable format into an IP address. 
An IP address is 4 bytes (represented by 4 numbers) which is a device's "address" on the internet.

To get the appropriate IP number, the browser would turn to a DNS - the web's "phone book". The search is conducted hierarchically - if the IP isn't stored on your browser, it would check your OS, then your ISP, and if your ISP can't find it, it will look further up the hierarchy.

Once IP is located, a connection with Google's servers is initiated:
 
![alt text](http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/wiredenterprise/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ff_googleinfrastructure_large.jpg "Google's Data Center")

- and your browser would send a HTTP request to Google's server.
Google would handle all these incoming requests using a load balancer.
Sometimes the same URL would lead to different servers, depending on the user's location and current traffic.
