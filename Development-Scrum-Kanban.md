Scrum is a development process in which related projects are split into small, concrete deliverables.  
The team then splits time into short "sprints" which are fixed-length iterations usually ~2 weeks long.
The purpose of this framework is to have small teams spending a short time on small projects rather than a large group spending a long time building large things.  Scrum is typically suited for projects where the work can be prioritized in batches or where priorities do not shift on a frequent basis.

Kanban is an alternative process in which the workflow is split into discrete stages.
The main feature of Kanban is limiting "work in process" by explicitly limiting how many items can be in progress at each workflow stage.   Another strong differentiating factor is that Kanban allows for a flexible to-do list where newly created stories can be quickly added and prioritized.

While there are many pros and cons to both Scrum and Kanban, and different use cases will be better suited for one or the other,
my main takeaway is that Kanban is ultimately a superior process.
This is due to the accretive nature of capturing value through Kanban, rather than waiting through a longer period where no value is captured,
then having a discrete step-up in value capture that is typical through Scrum.  Kanban will also typically be more cost effective than Scrum given Kanban limits waste through a "just-in-time" production/inventory management process while Scrum inherently is more costly both in terms of money and time expense given the longer duration of its development cycle.
