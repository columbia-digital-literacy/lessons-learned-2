#What Makes a Good Software Developer
A good software developer really should possess the following three characteristics. 

-They must seek continuous learning and self-improvement. A good developer constantly keeps abreast of new trends and technology and spends time learning and familiarizing him/herself with new programming languages

-They must be a good communicator. You will want to check in on their progress and they will need to clearly communicate the state of the project, additional work/resources needed, and any ideas for improvement.

-They must have some interest and curiousity in the space you are playing. If the developer doesn't care about the problem you are solving, you won't get top notch work.
