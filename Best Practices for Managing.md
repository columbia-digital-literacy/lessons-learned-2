Once you have hired a developer or developers, there are a number of considerations regarding best practices in managing their work.

As @JChan95 discussed, it is important to very clearly establish and define the workflow plan and how the process will get done. Once this happens, it's important to set a consistent rhythm for when theteam can get together to go over their progress and address and questions or concerns. You can't assume that a developer will speak up with something. You need to provide a forum for them to voice their opinions and ask key questions to draw out information.

It is also important to focus on detailed requirements. Obviously some broad, higher level information is important. However, it is important that you are able to effectively relay your vision and give detailed guidance. This can be done in the form of a user story or a detailed end-product requirement. But remember, don't be afraid to let them chime in with advice and potentially change the direction of things (if it's in an acceptable way). They are likely going to be more of a technical expert than you (as a manager) and will often have sound insights.
