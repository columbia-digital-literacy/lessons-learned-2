A User Story is an effective way to convey a desired feature of a product.  It should be written in the Connextra format, which is as follows:
* As a "role":
* I want "feature":
* So that "benefit":

So, for example, a purchasing manager that is looking to build an online interface / ordering system with his suppliers might specify:
* As a (role) purchasing manager
* I want (feature) tracking and reporting functionality
* So that (benefit) I can see orders in process and understand my past purchasing behavior

A collection of stories of a similar topic (i.e. could be "reporting" above) is called an Epic.  When needing to break down an Epic (and for stories in general), follow the INVEST framework, which is as follows:
* Independent: stories should be independent from each other
* Negotiable: follow the 3 C's; Card (user story on a sticky note), Conversation (sit with developers and chat about feature), and Confirmation (ask how developer is going to test the feature)
* Valuable: is there a benefit to the end-user?
* Estimable: if feature development is over 1 week, be worried
* Small: see above
* Testable: needs to be tested

Remember, "features" can be told from a different perspective "role," which can help the developer see the big picture.  Also, make sure that the benefit of the user story really does benefit the end user and isn't only a benefit for the company making the app (i.e. the end user doesn't care if a retailer's app makes the ordering process cheaper for the retailer).  Finally, you can also use the back of user story cards to write down acceptance criteria in order to validate that the user story has been implemented correctly.
