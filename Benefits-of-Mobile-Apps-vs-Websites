Building a mobile app or relying on a website is a key question faced by companies hoping to connect with customers.
The following is a number of key points when considering the benefits of having either an App or a Website:
- Although an app can be optimized for different platforms, a website generally gives you a wider reach.
- Websites also tend to be quicker to develop and bring to market.
- Apps tend to have hidden costs whereas website development is usually simpler
- Apps tend to have nore functionality compared to websites
- Apps can make use of push notifications on mobile devices and have offline capabilities unlike websites in general
- Apps tend to create a buzz, they're listed in app stores and can be easier to find, review and rate than websites
- Apps are generally more applicable to functions that need to be carried out at least once a week
