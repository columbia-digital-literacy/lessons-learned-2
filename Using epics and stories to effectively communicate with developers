Epics and stories are a great way to communicate with developers 
An epic is a "big" theme or idea that can contain multiple user stories 
A user story is a short statement that allows the user (or a developer speaking to another developer) to concisely
state what he wants to accomplish via a certain functionality. 
User stories are a great way to communicate because they quickly and clearly summarize what the user wants and why he wants it
Stories are generally written in the "As _, I would like to_, so that I can _." 
For example: As a user, I would like to have a shopping cart feature on the website, so that I can order multiple items 
at the same time
