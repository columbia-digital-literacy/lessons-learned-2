There is a dizzying array of programming languages available today.  
Here are some of the most common and some background information on their creation and uses.
C - C is the forefather of C++, C#, and a variety of other languages.  
It was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories.
Java – Java improved upon the capabilities of C and C++.  
It was developed to be run on any machine where the Java Virtual Machine is installed, regardless of underlying operating system.  
It was developed by James Gosling in 1990 at Sun Microsystems.  
It is often used to develop enterprise level software and video games.
C# - Developed by Microsoft in 2000, C# was part of the release of Microsoft’s .NET framework.  
Reportedly similar to Java in its capabilities, C# can be used to develop many types of software applications.
