Rather than tell the developer exactly what it is you want done, give him a vision statement for the app. This allows the developer to exercise initiative and deviate where necessary in order to better meet your intent. Make him a part of the creative process.

Specify the most important feature of your app that will differentiate it from other apps. You can say "It's like this app, except I want it to...." or "What I don't like about this existing app is..."

Give your developer several user stories about the app. As a (role, i.e. visitor, customer, administrator, etc.), I want (feature) so that (benefit). You don't want the developer to build the app just for the sake of building it; you want him to empathize with the end user so that he can cater it specifically to their needs. Additionally, make sure not to confuse benefits to the end user with benefits to the business owner (i.e. does the end user really care if the app makes life easier for the warehouse manager?)
