Hiring a good developer can be a challenge for a business team. The development process may seem foreign and the interview responses indecipherable. The process may seem daunting if the team does not know what to look for or the right questions to ask.  Below are a few simple questions to ask during the interview process to help decipher whether or not you want to hire a candidate.

1.	What version control system do you use? What other systems did you compare it to? And why did you decide to select this system?
2.	What unit-testing tool do you use? What other tools did you compare it to? And why did you decide to select this tool?
3.	What framework do you use? What other frameworks did you compare it to? And why did you decide to select this framework?

The beauty of these questions is that you do not need to fully understand the responses the candidate gives. Rather, you are looking to ensure that they are using all three of these tools and that they are being thoughtful about what they are using and why they are using it. If they are being thoughtful, understand the full landscape of options, and have weighed the pros and cons they are most likely going to be a prepared and competent developer.

Lastly, there are a few other things to ask and keep an eye out for. 

1.	Ask for their Github accountâ€”See what they post and how often they contribute. If they have suggested changes and their changes have been approved for any highly used code, you should hire them.
2.	Ask if they know any of the new up and coming code languages and how comfortable they are with them. If they know them well, you should hire them.
3.	Ask if they read [Hacker News](www.news.ycombinator.com). Make sure they are staying up to date on changes in the industry, new hot tools, products, languages, etc. Make sure your developers are keeping up with the rapid pace of change.

If you follow the above questions and guidelines chances are you will end up with a pretty good developer.
