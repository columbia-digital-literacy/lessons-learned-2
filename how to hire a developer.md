A good developer should:
- Keep asking questions
- Have a constant desire to learn
- Know multiple solutions to a problem
- Be comfortable with testing
- Have expertise
- Have a GitHub account with meaningful contributions
- Can answer the what, how, and why
- Be able to communicate effectively to determine product needs
- Should be attracted to the problem being solved
- Not "live with broken windows". This means that programmers and developers should not leave bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code unrepaire; that is, a good developer should fix something wrong as soon as it is discovered. 
 
When trying to hire a developer, make sure you:
- Ask programmer friends for their advice
- Ask a technical consultant to help you with the technical aspect of hiring the developer
- Ask the developer relevant questions about the job you are hiring them for
- Give relevant coding challenges to the candidate to see their methods for problem solving
- Ask questions to determine if there is a cultural fit
- Ask to see their portfolio
