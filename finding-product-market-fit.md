1/ Start with defining your audience, i.e., core customer group.  Better narrow it down to a specific group of people in a specific geographical location. Understand their pain points, your unique value prop, and avoid the urge to create something "nice to have for everyone yet essential for none" .  

2/ Come up withe a clear, coherent and logical user story -  who would be the typical user? what is he/she like  in terms of gender, age, income level, education etc?  and why would he/she have to use our product to solve a problem? Sample user story here: [I'm an inline-style link](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

3/ Brainstorm a feature set for your product. Then narrow your feature set down to one or two features that truly matter (i.e. absolutely necesssary to include in your product, no matter what). To determine which feature you should initially focus on, definitely spend time with customers, and examine areas where competitors fall short. 

4/ When conducting customer interviews, do not just start with your product/features. Always start with addressing customer's problems and see if they care to have your product as a solution to their problem.  Use neutual tone when asking questions, rather than "do you think it'd be nice to have feature XYZ" to get unbaised opinions. 

5/ Focus on one feature first, and avoid the urge to try get everything "automated" or "perferted" the first time.  If necessary, manually completing tasks is fine (e.g.  when customers go through "scheduling" or "matching" process,  it's ok to let your team handle those requests manually on the background, rather than trying to build codes to automate such processes, as long as your customer base is small enough). This allows your dev team to focus their limited time/energy/money on the most important stuff, get the demo out quickly, and get customer feedback quickly.  If you spend 5 days automating "scheduling" function and ended up finding customers hating that feature, your effort became useless. 

6/ If you work for a large corp, define your endeavor as an "experiment" rather than a new official "project" to avoid unnecessary attention from legal/compliance and win support from your senior management
