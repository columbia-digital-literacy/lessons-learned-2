##**Deciding When/How/What Software to Pursue**
So you have this awesome business idea. You are going to create a site (unsure of type of site) that keeps a public directory of all pilots. All passengers have the option to review the pilot. For travelers who are very scared of traveling this will help them decide whether or not to get on the plane or change flights (I know there are *HUGE* assumptions associated with this). But, now you have $100-$200K in funding and need to decide what to do. Well, good think I took Peter’s class. I know how to make that decision.

First you must analyze the target audience and decide if they are going to care about:

- Accessing this on the go (mobile)…the answer in this case is *YES*
- If mobile, are they going to want to access this from any device or are most of your potential users on iPhones and Androids?
- Furthermore, are your users particularly picky about smooth and “native” functionality?

If your answer is Yes 3 times, it then comes down to funding. If you have the funds to pursue native applications, then it might make sense. However, there is smooth alternatives such as Titanium and PhoneGap that will allow you to ship a movie web app and iOS and Android applications (with slightly less polished functionality and look).

Here is a great [blog](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/titanium-vs-phonegap-cross-platform-mobile-framework/) discussing the pros and cons of each.

And that’s a wrap
