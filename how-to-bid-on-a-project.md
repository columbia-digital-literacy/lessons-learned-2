Hourly vs Fixed Bids
======================
When you start writing a software project, you are dumb. Only as the project starts to form do you start to get smart about what the project's final form should look like. At the outset of a project it is hard to predict what the project will exactly entail. In a fixed bid, you are essentially "locking in your ignorance" at the outset of the product, instead of adapting the product as you learn more. That is why it is smarter to submit hourly bids rather than fixed bids. 

Hourly Bids
-----------
*With an hourly bid you get flexibility. In a a fixed bid, you risk the dev team fulfilling the entire project you specified, even if they know you don't need it. You won't know that you don't need those extra features until about halfway through the project, but with a fixed bid you've already locked in paying for those features. 
*An hourly bid ensures that your product meets your needs and doesn't include extraneous parts that do not.

Fixed Bids
-----------
*In a fixed bid, the programmer is going to make sure he doesn't lose money in the project, so at least 10% of the price will be a built in insuance padding for the programmer to make sure the product doesn't take more time and resources that the price is worth, so you are paying at least a 10% markup from the outset. 
*A fixed bid also misaligns interests in the project. The dev's team's interest is getting the project dont with as little required resources as possible, whereas your interest is in squezing as much work out of them as possible for the price you paid. 
*In a fixed bid, more time is spent arguing than in an hourly bid as the customer tries to get more for the money he ahs already paid while the dev team is arguing to include less. 15% or more of the time in a fixed bid project is spent arguing over deliverables. 
*Time to market is typically longer in a fixed bid project. If the dev team is given three months, they will almost always take the entire amount of time that they were allotted to deliver the product. 
*The only exception is trvial projects (i.e. hiring someone to update your wordpress site) where you could specify the project with sufficient certainty as to what the final product should look like and the amount of time it should take.
