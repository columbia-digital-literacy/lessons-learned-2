Hourly vs Fixed Bids

When you start writing a software project, you are dumb. Only as the project starts to form do you start to get smart about


With an hourly bid you get flexibility. In a a fixed bid, you risk the dev team fulfilling the entire project you specified, even if they know you don't need it. 

In a fixed bid, the programmer is going to make sure he doesn't lose money in the project, so at least 10% of the price

The only exception is trvial projects (i.e. hiring someone to update your wordpress site) where you could specify the project with sufficient certainty as to what the final product should look like and the amount of time it should take.
