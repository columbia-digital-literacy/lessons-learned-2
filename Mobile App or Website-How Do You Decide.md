Many young, aspiring entrepreneurs ready to disrupt to the status quo will quickly find themselves faced with the question: “Do I build a mobile app or a website first?”

Before deep diving into the question, the first thing to do is clear up the belief that mobile means app.  50-70% of the population use mobile as their primary point of access, so it is critical that about how to make functionality available on mobile, but mobile is not just phones, tablets, phablets, etc.  Mobile can also be a website, and can be compatible on a computer or device on the go.  Recognizing this will make it easier to reconsider making an in-fashion app and to give extra consideration to the often-overlooked website.

A few other facts to know, mobile site wins on time to market, budget, and simplicity (1 unique piece of software vs. 2), so for companies started out, building an MVP, on a budget, or in a time crunch, starting with a mobile site is a better choice. Additional considerations are the reach and skills of your developer or dev team.

There are benefits to an app.  Depending on the ways in which the user will be interacting with the platform, how frequently, and from where, it maybe better to go mobile app.  It allows you to do more using the elements of the phone, like the camera or contacts, and access to user data can inform the way you iterate the app or the way you monetize.  An app can speak right to the device.  And in a world of mobile and apps every damn day, a great mobile app can build a lot of buzz for your business.

So, deciding means thinking about budget, time to market, simplicity, the competitive advantage and value proposition of product or service.  If having an app isn’t essential to he operations of the product or service, probably best to put it on the back burner and start with a website that is mobile friendly.  Learn what works and get the dollars flowing before investing in complex mobile app.
