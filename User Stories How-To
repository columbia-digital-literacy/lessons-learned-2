How to write effective User Stories
A User Story is an effective way to convey a desired feature of a product.  It should be written in the Connextra format , which is as follows:
- As a "role":
- I want "feature":
- So that "benefit":
So, for example, for a purchasing manager that is looking to build a interface with his suppliers, he might specify:
- As a (role): purchasing manager
- I want (feature): tracking and reporting functionality
- So that (benefit): I can see orders in process and understand my past purchasing behavior
A collection of stories of a similar topic (could be "reporting" above) is called an epic.  When needing to break down an epic (and for stories in general), follow the INVEST framework, which is as follows:
- Independent: stories should be independent from each other
- Negotiable: follow the 3 C's; Card (user story on a sticky note), Conversation (sit with developers and chat about feature), and Confirmation (ask how developer is going to test the feature)
- Valuable: is there a benefit to the end-user?
- Estimable: if feature development is over 1 week, be worried
- Small: see above
- Testable: needs to be tested
