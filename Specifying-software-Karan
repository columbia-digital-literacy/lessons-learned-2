Specifying software takeaways:
Survery end users to identify what they're looking for
Use the jobs-to-be-done framework to identify the problem that you're trying to solve
Think about whether someone should do web only vs. app, etc.
Describe what you want to the developer. However, it will likely not be what you need 
Describe user personas
Use prototyping to develop a Minimum Viable Product
Don't build software till you need to!
