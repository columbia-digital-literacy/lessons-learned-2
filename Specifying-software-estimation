When asking developer for a time estimate - first ask yourself why you need an estimate in the first place, and whether you need a time estimate or cost estimate.
If it is related to time, is it simply because you are worried about the efficiency of the developer or is it because there is an upcoming deadline?
It is easier for developers to give an estimate based on costs.  Rather than ask them outright how much something is going to cost, try to give them a range.  For example, this project can cost between $20,000 and $50,000, and no more.  Costs are easier for developers to estimate, and if they are given a range or upper bound.
