##Leveraging Kanban Boards to Manage Projects##

***Kanban Board Overview***

  Who knew that whiteboards and sticky notes could be so powerful! :clap: 
  
  Often when collaborating in teams and across multiple departments, it is difficult to keep track of all aspects of the project and the workflow. The kanban boards provide this central, visual place for all departments to know what each is working on, and shows the status of each development item.
  
  I found these boards to be extremely powerful, from basic boards such as:
  
                  To-Do     |     Doing     |   Done       |  Revisit
              :----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------:|:-----------:
                            |               |              |
                            |               |              |  
  
  to more complicated boards such as:

                  To-Do     |     Design    |  Development |   QA        | Production
              :----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:
                            |               |              |             |
                            |               |              |             |

  It seems like there are quite a few online tools that enable you to manage Kanban boards in the cloud if you choose, rather than the physical whiteboards and sticky notes. One site that follows the *lean* thought process is: [*LeanKit*](http://leankit.com/kanban/kanban-board/).
  
  I like the interactiveness of the boards so that the collaborators have a sense of ownership and accomplishment with the simple act of moving the sticky-note from one column to the next, whether it be a pull from the queue for new work, or a move to the queue for completion.
  
  
  ***Adapting Kanban Boards for Sales*** :moneybag:
  
  Although I am currently not managing a development team, I decided to adapt the kanban concept to my current team's sales initiatives, and created boards for each of our accounts and the business initiatives that we would like to achieve. The boards look something like this:
  
              Identify (*Cold Prospects*)| Working (*Warm*)     |   Advanced (*Hot*)      |  *Closed* Sale!
              :----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------:|:-----------:
                            |               |              |
                            |               |              |  


  We are so accustomed to the same project management process through excel, that it started to become mundane. As a result, both the quality of our interactions and morale was decreasing. The goal of the adapted kanban boards is to create this 'information radiator' to engage the team with more intel on what others on the same account are working on, as well as to create more awareness and buzz across the sales floor.
  
  My team has been engaging with this method for the past 5 days, and so far we have been much more collaborative and interactive. I have observed that the team morale has seemed to pick up as the sticky notes are sparking more discussions and conversations across the team. Furthermore, members of other teams and regions are coming by our pod area and asking about the boards and what we are working on. I have also noticed that many people on my team are much more visual and have favored the colorful sticky notes and the creative feel.
  
  So far so good...! :smile:
