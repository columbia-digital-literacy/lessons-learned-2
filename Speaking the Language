Programmers use many terms that seem foreign to executives with no prior technical training or expertise.  
While becoming a subject matter expert is in no way a necessary characteristic of a successful executive, a basic understanding of some of the key terms and acronyms should serve as a basic framework with which an executive can learn to communicate with developers. 
Here is a brief overview of some of the most important terms for executives to know.
First, developers often speak of 'front end' and 'back end' lanaguages.
Front end languages are used to design interfaces that the user can see, such as the text you are reading now.
Back end languages are used to design functionality and features that aren't as visible to the eye, such as a drop down box suggesting terms when entering word(s) into a search box.
Some common front end langauges include the following:
  HTML (Hypertext Markup Langage): text you see on a page
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheet): makes HTML text look pretty
  JS (Java Script):  features like animation, validation, etc.
Back end languages are more numerous, but some of the more common include the following:
  Java: the most popular language
  C#: Microsoft's version of Java
  Ruby: more commonly used for startups 
Below is a list of some other commonly used terms and acronyms that an executive should be familiar with:
  ISP (internet service provider): e.g. Comcast or Verizon
  DNS (domain name server): turns a human readable site name (e.g. github.com) into an IP address
  IP address (internet protocoal): unique identifying number for each internet connection
