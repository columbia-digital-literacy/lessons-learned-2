The majority of page views come from mobile devices. 
Every company that wants to be 'connected' needs a mobile-optimized website.
In some case, a  mobile app may also be suitable in addition to the website.
There are three approaches to develop a mobile app:
* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)/[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org)
* [Titanium Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com) and [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com)
* Native application
Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantes. 
I would ask myself two major questions before deciding which is the right one for the app I'm developing:
1) How many platforms (iOS, Android, Windows,...) do I want to develop the app for? Hybrid technologies such as PhoneGap and Titanium make it easier to optimize for different platforms without re-writing the code. Going Native instead requires a very different language for each platform, meaning higher costs, longer timing and generally more programmers to hire (very few know well enough two-three different languages). 
2) What hardware-functionalities does the app use? Native languages allow to better communicate with hardware and therefore use more and better the hardware-functionalities available. Hybrid technologies are limited in this respect.
Once you have the aswers to those questions pick the techology which is most effective.
Remember to make the decision based on your situation in that very moment. Any choice you make, you will still have to re-write all your code in a year or two in order to make the app scalable.
