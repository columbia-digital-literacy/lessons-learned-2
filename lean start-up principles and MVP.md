- Lean start-up principles can help you test your assumptions before ever specifying or building software
- This is not just for start-ups; it can be applied to corporate settings as well (intrapreneurship)
- You should start with a hypothesis about what the problem is, and brainstorm ways to solve it
- Then test your assumptions via potential customer interviews and/or a prototype or minimal viable product (MVP)
- For interviews, if first 5 customers agree with you, you can probably stop
- Sometimes you can take a shortcut on the interviews if you are a member of the target audience
- In corporate settings, it is sometimes easier to call this phase an "experiment" in order to run with an idea without official approval
- MVPs can take a number of different forms:
  - Video about how your product would work
  - "Wizard of oz" model where humans mimic what you would then build software to automate. This helps you learn what people want.
  - Cobble together the capabilities you want by outsourcing using SAS (e.g. Shopify, Square Space, etc.) to see if your idea works before building your own software
- Bottom line: Don't build software until you need to and have identified the problem and the solution.

Below are some examples of the MVPs of companies that are now well known:
